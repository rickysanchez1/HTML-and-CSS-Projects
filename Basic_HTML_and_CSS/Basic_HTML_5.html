		Character Entities and how to use them.
	</h1>

	<p>
		Character Entities are reserved characters in HTML and must be replaced with alternative characters.
		There are 2 ways you can type entity names. With numbers or with letters.
        <br>
		I needed to type "&ampamp" in order to display the & next to the entity name or numbers. Such as "&amp#60" for <
	</p>

	<h3>Below are some of the entities you need to use in order to use the characters in your code.</h3>

	<table width="20%">
