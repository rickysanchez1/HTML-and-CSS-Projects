# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

These are sample websites I made using HTML and CSS.

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Delicious Cupcakes!</li>
  <li>Movie Theatre Site</li>
</ul>

<h2>Delicious Cupcakes!</h2>
This page is an example home page for a Cupcake business that creates custom cupcakes of your choosing. It is styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

<h2>Movie Theatre Site</h2>
This page is an example home page for a Movie theatre that is styled using Bootsrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
